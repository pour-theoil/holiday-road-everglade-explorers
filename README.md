# Holiday Road from Nashville

Single page site that lets a user select a national park, a relevent attraction and restaurant for a trip. The user then gets information about each site including details and weather. The user then can save the trip and go back to that itinerary later.

## Project Goals

Illustrate the use of API calls and filtering data to add to the UI. Setting up a local api to do the CRUD for the site. Helped get an understanding of projects taking longer time. This project also helped reinforce the ideas of scrum.

### Getting Started

Once the user enters the site they must first select the national park they wish to visit. Then they choose the attraction and eatery that they would like added to their itinerary. Once they have selected the information for there itinerary they can choose to save the itinerary by clicking the Save Itinerary button. The saved itinerary is then listed on the right side of the screen. The user may then click on itinerary name to see the details of the saved itinerary.

### Getting started with the project

To start, clone or copy the repository and place it in the root of your web directory. The project requires json-server to be running in order to interact with the local API. 'json-server --watch db.json --port 8088'. You should now be able to serve index.html and go through the functionality of the project.
